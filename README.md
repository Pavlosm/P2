Short description
-----------------
P2 is a XKCD style password generator. It includes the generator and a 
description of what XKCD password is.

Notes for TA
------------
The words for the password are chosen randomly from a text file with ","
separated words. This file is populated from the 15 pages of the 
http://www.paulnoll.com website with the 3000 most used words in the US.
There are two .php files (apart from the index.php), where the one has the 
logic for the password generator and the other one has the logic for the 
creation of the word_DB.txt.

Finally, the plan was to have a separate stylesheet defining the additional
style for the project but this was not working on Mozilla and Internet Explorer
so the style is included in the index.php.
